# Upgraded_blinking_LED_with_RaspberryPi
This is a project which illustates how to use a Raspberry Pi 4 to control an LED based on the input of a button connected to it. The LED keeps blinking with a frequency of 1 Hertz while the button is unpressed and stays on continuously while it pressed.


The LED is connected to its pin 8 and the button to 10 through a pull down resistor.
Below is the link to the demonsitation of it.
